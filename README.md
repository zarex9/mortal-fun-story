# AI Crypto Story 🎙️✨

**Transform your crypto transaction history into an epic, AI-narrated saga. Mint your favorite on-chain moments as unique NFTs, share your story, and compete with the community.**

AI Crypto Story converts the cold, technical data of blockchain transactions into engaging, personalized, and shareable narrative experiences. Instead of deciphering Etherscan logs, you hear a story.

> **"You just swapped 0.5 ETH for 20,000 PEPE on Uniswap — a bold move! Let’s hope those frogs can swim."**
